# Analysis of Pitchfork Reviews

## Data Description
This is a data set of music reviews from the website Pitchfork.com. The data contains features such as artists, labels, review content, review scores, year, etc.

## Background
I'm an avid viewer of Pitchfork music reviews, and I wanted to dive deeper into their album scores and how they vary from genre to genre, and year by year. I also wanted to see if there exists a correlation between review length and the score of the review, and also the variation of scores from who wrote the reviews.

Here, its worth noting that records containing music labeled as 'Best New Music' were rated with a score of 8 and above. This makes sense considering an album with that type of positive score.

It looks like in the early 2000's, genre's tended to vary a bit more when compared to later years. We see that years post-2005 that genres tend to average out around the 6 to 8 range.

Even though it is not the strongest, we do see a positive correlation between an album's score and its review length. This would make sense through an author's perspective. If you really do admire a record, you'd want to say as much as you can about it, would you not?

## Conclusion
Music, much like a lot of other forms of art, is subjective. Just by looking at the chart of author's and how they usually rate records, one can easily see that some author's are pickier than others and vice versa. More on subjectivity, a reviewer absolutely would love to go on and on about a record they gave a high score. Makes sense. Who wouldn't want to say all they can about something they absolutely love in order to influence someone to do the same.
